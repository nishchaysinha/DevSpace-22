<h3 align="left">Why this topic?</h3>

<div align="left">

  Being students from the 2025 batch, we truly understand the importance of good collaboration tool. Which is exactly why we chose this topic as we aim to eliminate the issues that lie with current solutions. The √âtudie app is built with only one thing in mind, strong and effective cooperation between individuals without the requirement of switching tools every minute. 
  
  Our solution integrates some of the most essential tools like realtime drawing boards, smooth video playback, voicechat with transcription(using [Symbl.ai](https://symbl.ai/)), inbuilt realtime code editors and compilers for prototyping and an inbuilt document editor.
  
  [These features are easily customizable and can be customized according to what a user needs because of our heavily modular application.]
